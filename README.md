# My_Pizza
The application consists of two interfaces: desktop (**Windows**) and mobile (**Windows Phone**), which use a shared service (**ASP.NET Web API 2**) to communicate with a database (**SQL server 2014**).
The application was created in the **C#** programming language.

The Desktop part represents the administrative part of the application, with a part for reporting. The mobile part of the app allows you to view product catalogs, create orders, and review activity history (earlier orders, services used, etc.).
